| Component      | Quantity | Link | Notes |
| -------------- | -------- | ---- | ----- |
| PCB            | 1        | n/a  | This can be bought as part of a Panel + PCB kit from the [Allen Synthesis website](www.allensynthesis.co.uk) or ordered using the gerber files in this repository |
| Panel          | 1        | n/a  | "     |
| USB-A Connector | 2     | [CPC](https://cpc.farnell.com/multicomp/usb-a-s-vt/usb-2-0-type-a-receptacle-th/dp/CN22155?ost=cn22155) | Other vertical USB-A connectors may work, however only this one has been confirmed to fit on the PCB |
| Shrouded 16 Pin Header | 1 | [CPC](https://cpc.farnell.com/amphenol/t821116a1s100ceu/header-vertical-2-54mm-16way/dp/CN16429?st=16%20way%20header%20shrouded) / [CPC Alternative](https://cpc.farnell.com/wurth-elektronik/61201621621/header-2-54mm-vertical-16way/dp/CN17032?st=16%20way%20header%20shrouded) / [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/eurorack-diy-essentials/) | These headers are standard for Eurorack power connectors so can be bought from many different places |
| M3 13mm Standoff | 2 | [CPC](https://cpc.farnell.com/ettinger/05-03-133/spacer-m3x13-ni/dp/PC02612?st=13mm%20standoff) | Any M3 13mm standoff will work, made of pretty much any material. As long as your screws and standoff match in pitch and the length is 13mm, they'll work |
| M3 Screw | 4 (+ 2 more if you haven't already got some to mount the module to your rails) | [CPC 100 pack](https://cpc.farnell.com/nettlefolds/1961030006071do/torx-screws-m3-x-6mm/dp/FN01345?st=m3%20screw) | These are the same screws as you use to attach your modules to the rails, so if you already have them then there's no need to order more for this module |
| 3mm Flat Top LED | 1 | [CPC](https://cpc.farnell.com/kingbright/l-424idt/led-flat-top-3mm-he-red/dp/SC11543?st=kingbright%20led%203mm) / [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/new-style-flat-top-leds-turing-pulses-vactrol-mix/) | These don't have to be flat-top if you have any other 3mm LEDs (of any colour) but these are the only ones I have calculated the brightness for and tested in the module |
| 4.7k Resistor | 1 | [CPC 50 pack](https://cpc.farnell.com/unbranded/mf25-4k7/resistor-0-25w-1-4k7/dp/RE03757?st=4k7%20resistor) | Any 4.7k resistor at all will do, of any reasonable tolerance. You can also use higher or lower values for brighter or dimmer LED appearance, but 4.7k with the LEDs listed in this bill of materials are the only ones which have been tested |
| Schottky Diode | 1 | [CPC](https://cpc.farnell.com/stmicroelectronics/bat48/diode-schottky-small-signal/dp/SC07328) | This can be any Schottky diode which fits, however if you want the +5V rail to power the USB sockets with a high enough voltage to meet USB specifications, then a low voltage drop (the linked diode has an acceptable drop of 400mV) is required |
